THE BOOK OF KLYDE!

so obviously we are very family oriented and just want to share the love, personal info on me would be things like my family comes from light military backgrounds where it has influenced most of my kin including me. If it has to do with the troops I support it, so you know, definitely a Patriot. i was really big into skateboarding in my not so younger days lol. My finger tattoos are from my old skate crew we called "Instinct", never took off as a skater but i got the Name from my apparent lifestyle, you know living off of Instinct. Might be useful info might not, I get a lot of comment about those in particular though.

I've played games as long as i can remember so long time fan of 'em. I remember playing Rampage and goldeneye the n64 version with my family a lot. Its only grown more a part of me as I grow older. So no chance I see myself putting down the joys anytime soon. A long with feeling like sharing the love I just feel better when I'de have friends or even someone I don't quite know yet to chat to while we "Take Objective A" lol, its not always about the game to me i guess, it's about getting to share moments and stories with others and finding common ground. obviously not everyone wants to connect but i do my best to be positive for others.
sorry for the books lol but i hope that kinda gets you started on the bio you wanted
